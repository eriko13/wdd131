# WDD 131 - Dynamic Web Fundamentals

This repository contains the coursework for WDD 131 - Dynamic Web Fundamentals.

## Image Requirements

The website requires two images that need to be added to the `images` directory:

1. `erik-portrait.webp` - A portrait image of Erik German
2. `mexico-flag.webp` - An image of the Mexico flag

You can create these images yourself or download appropriate images from free stock photo websites like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay. Make sure to optimize the images for web use (reduce file size while maintaining quality).

## File Structure

- `index.html` - The main entry point of the website
- `styles/base.css` - The main CSS file for styling the website
- `scripts/getdates.js` - JavaScript file for dynamic date functionality
- `images/` - Directory for storing image files

## Why is the main file named "index.html"?

It's a common convention in web development to name the main entry point of a website or directory "index.html". This convention originated from early web servers, which would automatically serve an "index.html" file when a directory was accessed without specifying a file name.

When a user navigates to a URL like `https://example.com/` or `https://example.com/about/`, the web server looks for an `index.html` file in the corresponding directory and serves it automatically. This makes URLs cleaner and more user-friendly by not requiring the explicit filename in the URL.
