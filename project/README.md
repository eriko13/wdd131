# Camilo's Corner

A website dedicated to sharing the joy and adventures of living with Camilo, a 3-year-old Chihuahua mix.

## Project Overview

Camilo's Corner is a personal website built to showcase my pet dog Camilo's life, adventures, and to share pet care tips based on my experiences as a dog owner. The website features responsive design and interactive elements, making it accessible and engaging across various devices.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Introduction to Camilo and his story
- **Adventures Page**: Blog-style posts documenting Camilo's adventures with filter functionality
- **Gallery Page**: Photo gallery with timeline slider to view Camilo's growth from puppy to adult
- **Pet Care Tips Page**: Practical advice for dog owners with tabbed content organization
- **References Page**: Citations for all external content used on the website

## Technical Implementation

- HTML5 for semantic structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- JavaScript for interactivity (filtering, lightbox, memory wall, etc.)
- localStorage for saving user preferences and form submissions

## Responsive Design

The website is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across:
- Mobile phones (portrait and landscape)

The navigation menu transforms to a hamburger menu on smaller screens for better usability.
