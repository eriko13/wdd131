W06 Project
Overview
The final website project is a comprehensive assessment that gives you an opportunity to demonstrate your mastery of the course learning outcomes in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For this project, you will create a dynamic and responsive website that adheres to development standards.

Project Requirements
This project will be of your own design and development. You may not consult nor work with any other individual nor group on the project. The content and subject comes from your topic proposal, and the site should be complete without any placeholders. The images and brief verbiage may be referenced from other sources, and you will need to cite these sources on a separate page. Link this reference page (which does not need to be styled) in the footer of your website.

Your project must meet the following functional and developmental specifications.

These are the minimum specifications for the project. You are encouraged to go above and beyond these requirements to demonstrate your mastery of the course learning outcomes.

Your website project must be hosted on GitHub and rendered via GitHub Pages.
The website must consist of at least three (3) pages with a common navigation and theme that appeals to the target audience.
The site must have significant and relevant content that supports the purpose of the site as outlined in your website plan.
The design must support accessibility, usability, visual appeal, and design principles.
Structure the pages with valid, standards-based HTML markup.
Style the site with valid CSS that does not contain unused and unnecessary (duplicate) declarations and rules.
Style the site so that it is responsive to mobile (portrait and landscape) and larger screen views without violating PARC design principles.
All images must be optimized.
Use a lazy loading technique to support progressive design.
Use an HTML form that meets the standards presented in the course.
The site must have dynamic elements powered by Javascript including the following:
✔ Have more than one function,
✔ Include DOM interaction including selecting an element, modifying it, and listening for and reacting to events,
✔ Use conditional branching,
✔ Use objects, arrays, and array methods,
✔ Exclusively use template literals when building strings for output
✔ Use localStorage.
Ensure there are no spelling or grammatical errors.
Complete the project by the due date.
This web course intended to help you learn how to construct dynamic and responsive websites using the core web technologies of contemporary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Third party templates are NOT allowed. Pages built from site builder software or drag-and-drop tools or that are based on existing sites are not allowed and will lead to no credit on this project.
